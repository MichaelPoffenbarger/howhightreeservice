For most deciduous trees, the ideal time is during the dormant season, typically late winter to early spring before new growth begins. During this period, trees are less susceptible to stress and disease, and the structure is more visible without foliage."

            "content": "However, timing can vary depending on the tree species and specific objectives. Spring-flowering trees should be pruned immediately after they finish blooming to avoid removing next year's flower buds. Trees with heavy sap flow, like maples and birches, may benefit from summer trimming to avoid excessive bleeding."
